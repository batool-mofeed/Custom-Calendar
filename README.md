## Features

- Navigate between months.
- Mark specific days as needed.

## Installation

To use Custom Calendar in your Android project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or physical device.

## Usage

Custom Calendar is designed as a sample project, but you can use its components as a starting point for your own calendar-related applications. Here's an overview of the key components:

### `MainActivity`

This is the main activity that holds the calendar. It initializes the calendar view, handles navigation between months, and defines off-days (holidays) for demonstration purposes.

### `CalendarAdapter`

The `CalendarAdapter` is responsible for populating the RecyclerView with calendar items. It also customizes the appearance of days, including marking holidays and highlighting the current day.

### Layouts

The XML layout files (`activity_main.xml` and `item_calendar.xml`) define the UI components used in the app. You can customize these layouts to match your design requirements.

### Data Binding

Data Binding is used to bind data between the UI elements and the underlying data model. The XML layouts and the `MainActivity` class demonstrate how to use Data Binding for efficient UI updates.
